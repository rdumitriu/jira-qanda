=================================================================

Was ever your comment actually a question ? Was ever your question lost in
the tons of email notifications from JIRA ? If yes, this plugin is for you.

What it adds to your JIRA is a little bit of formalism when asking questions
and when responding to them. If your team does Agile in an unknown field, you
need this, trust me. If you have many questions like 'Do you want it blue
or purple?' you will want it badly.

How was this plugin born ? My use case.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Well, I have a SCRUM project: a chemistry one. We had to put molecules and
mass-spectra on screen, manipulate them, search for similarities, isomers,
deal with various chemistry problems, and so on.

You can imagine that none from my team - including me - was ready to cope with
so much chemistry information (both my parents are chemists, so I absolutely
hated organic chemistry back in high-school!... not anymore the case, but that
part is lost anyway ..).
Anyway, in this project, I had the luck to deal with some world-class chemists.
Apart from being nice human beings, they had almost an infinite patience
explaining us some concepts. I opened our JIRA to them, so the teams can quickly
communicate (BTW, the chemists absolutely LOVE JIRA!).

However, it became soon obvious that commenting or altering the description of
the issue is not enough. We needed some kind of formalism so we can keep track
of our chemistry ignorance in the project.

This is how this plugin was born.

How it is used ?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once installed, it gives you an extra panel on your issues: the questions panel.
People can use that panel to add questions related to the issue and receive
answers. Once one or more answers are approved, questions can be added to the
description of the issue by a simple click.

To keep track of the unresolved questions, a gadget is provided. It looks for
issues in the specified time interval - check the configuration - and shows you
unresolved questions. Having it near your activity stream will point out very
quickly what piece of info is missing to the developer.
