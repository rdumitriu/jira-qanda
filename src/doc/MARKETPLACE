The text below is the plugin description on Atlassian Marketplace
=================================================================

QandA is a collaboration tool between the programmers and certain experts in a
given field and / or customers. What it does is that it imposes a little bit of formalism when adding
questions to your issues and when responding to them, thus focusing teams and
experts alike to resolve unknowns before the coding starts.

Using QandA will lower the quantity of impeding issues in your projects; it helps
also the project managers and SCRUM masters by reducing the communication proxy tasks,
inherent to any project, big or small. Underspecified environments, such as Agile
projects (but this 'underspecified' attribute applies as well to large categories of
Waterfall projects) will simply go smoother using QandA.

Once the question is clarified, answers - and the question that generated them - can be
added into your issue description with a simple click, thus making the resolution more
visible in your issue specification.

This plugin appeared as a necessity in a real project; you will find the original
motivation here: https://github.com/rdumitriu/jira-qanda/wiki/Motivation

QandA PRO is the same great plugin as its completely free version [::TODO:: link here]
but adds several features you will love:

1. QandA PRO is far more aggressive with the notifications; each question or answers
notifies the reporter, the assignee and the watchers automatically, besides the users
mentioned in the question and the answers;

2. QandA PRO offers global and per project expert groups. Instead of mentioning all the
people, one by one, you simply will mention: @expertgroup;

3. QandA PRO offers additional gadgets and configuration options;

4. QandA PRO provides workflow integration, you can block an issue advancement in the
workflow if there are open questions; for this purpose we provide both a condition and
a validator.

Please read the wiki to understand how it works: https://github.com/rdumitriu/jira-qanda/wiki
