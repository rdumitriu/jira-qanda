FUNCTIONALITIES

1/ Forget for now about recipients. These are public questions.
Maybe future versions, since it can be easily expanded, plus it reduces the
development time. Actually, we want something like automated recipients finds.

2/ No modify besides delete. Delete can only be performed by the owner if no
restrictions are applied (question is answered, answer is approved). This is to
avoid discussions (like: "I didn't asked THAT ...")

3/ Add to description functionality (once approved).

4/ Add to comments functionality (once approved)
