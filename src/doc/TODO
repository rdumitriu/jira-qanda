MUST DO:
Technical stuff:
a) Answers should be taken via a REST call, not directly in the VT.
b) Clear the beans, separate clearly the UI from base to limit the network transported data.
c) UI changes:
    c.1) Gadget styles + add Issue summary
    c.2) First question is special
d) Base:
    d.1) Create special routines (question has answers), etc
    d.2) Put same checks on REST services too. Right now checks happen only in VT

1. If answer is approved:
Add to description functionality. Add to comments functionality

2. Edit:
Impr: if we do not have an answer, we should be able to edit the question
Impr: if the answer is not approved, we should be able to edit the answer

3. Localization of qanda.js, gadget, etc
